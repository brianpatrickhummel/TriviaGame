## My second application: a simple trivia game.

This Trivia Game is a responsive Javascript application that focuses on the use of Javascript Timing Events.  The DOM is manipulated via jQuery.  Animate.css library was used for animations, FontAwesome framework for Icons, and Bootstrap framework for responsive-layout. 

 ### Features:
 * Player has 15 seconds to select 1 of 4 possible answers to a trivia question
 * When time runs out or a guess is made, the correct answer is then displayed
 * At the end of the game, the overall results of the game are displayed, showing the number of correct answers, incorrect answers and questions that went unanswered.
